I have included the shebang to make it executable with `chmod +x`. The template CLI will ask for input, do
some work, and accomplish some sort of task.


### What Goes into a README?

This README serves as a template. Replace the contents of this file to describe
the important files in your project and describe what they do. Each Python file
that you edit should get at least a paragraph, and each function should be
described with a sentence or two.

Describe your actual CLI script first, and with a good level of detail. The rest
should be ordered by importance to the user. (Probably functions next, then
models.)

Screenshots and links to resources that you used throughout are also useful to
users and collaborators, but a little more syntactically complicated. Only add
these in if you're feeling comfortable with Markdown.
